# Pseudoranger_trials
The code is incomplete for now, however the model is running fine. The model has two intermediate layers.
Keras uses theano for its backend.

* The X's and Y's are estimated separately. And then plotted against the jittery orbit. The results however uptill now are not satisfactory.
* The Convolutional averaging filter performs much better as compared to the previous regression based model.

The code is still in development phase. More models are being tried.
